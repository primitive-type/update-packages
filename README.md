## Update Atom packages

Runs `apm upgrade`. This will update all *non-core* Atom packages that you currently have
installed.

This package is basically a direct clone of
[update-package-dependencies](https://github.com/atom/update-package-dependencies)
but instead of updating a particular package's dependencies, it will update all
 installed Atom packages to their latest version.
